I made a website for an artist in 7 days, my first time ever touching web development. I worked based on references, hence the playful look. Not sure how to spice it up with better animations, but I tried making it responsive and mobile friendly. She really liked it.
I also made an admin panel and a log in-log out system for her to upload new art.

I'll include only the code I'd like to showcase
